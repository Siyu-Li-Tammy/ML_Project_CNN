    "# Convolutional Neural Networks with PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Deep Learning\" is a general term that usually refers to the use of neural networks with multiple layers that synthesize the way the human brain learns and makes decisions. A convolutional neural network is a kind of neural network that extracts *features* from matrices of numeric values (often images) by convolving multiple filters over the matrix values to apply weights and identify patterns, such as edges, corners, and so on in an image. The numeric representations of these patterns are then passed to a fully-connected neural network layer to map the features to specific classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several commonly used frameworks for creating CNNs. In this notebook, we'll build a simple example CNN using PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Import libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's install and import the PyTorch libraries we'll need."

After each epoch, a loss function measures the error (*loss*) in the model and adjusts the weights (which were randomly generated for the first iteration) to try to improve accuracy. \n",

    "> **Note**: We're only using 5 epochs to minimize the training time for this simple example. A real-world CNN is usually trained over more epochs than this. CNN model training is processor-intensive, involving a lot of matrix and vector-based operations; so it's recommended to perform this on a system that can leverage GPUs, which are optimized for these kinds of calculation. This will take a while to complete on a CPU-based system - status will be displayed as the training progresses."
