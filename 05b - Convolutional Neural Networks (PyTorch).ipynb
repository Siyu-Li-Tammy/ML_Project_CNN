    "# Convolutional Neural Networks with PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Deep Learning\" is a general term that usually refers to the use of neural networks with multiple layers that synthesize the way the human brain learns and makes decisions. A convolutional neural network is a kind of neural network that extracts *features* from matrices of numeric values (often images) by convolving multiple filters over the matrix values to apply weights and identify patterns, such as edges, corners, and so on in an image. The numeric representations of these patterns are then passed to a fully-connected neural network layer to map the features to specific classes.\n",

    "There are several commonly used frameworks for creating CNNs. In this notebook, we'll build a simple example CNN using PyTorch.\n",
